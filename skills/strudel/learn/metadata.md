# Music metadata

You can optionally add some music metadata in your Strudel code, by using tags in code comments:

```js
// @title My Cool Song
// @by John Doe
// @license CC-BY-SA-4.0
```

Like other comments, those are ignored by Strudel, but it can be used by other tools to retrieve some information about the music.

## Alternative syntax

You can also use comment blocks:

```js
/*
@title My Cool Song
@by John Doe
@license CC-BY-SA-4.0
*/
```

Or define multiple tags in one line:

```js
// @title My Cool Song @by John Doe @license CC-BY-SA-4.0
```

The `title` tag has an alternative syntax using quotes (must be defined at the very begining):

```js
// "My Cool Song" @by John Doe
```

## Tags list

Available tags are:

- `@title`: music title
- `@by`: music author(s), separated by comma, eventually followed with a link in `<>` (ex: `@by John Doe <https://example.com>`)
- `@license`: music license(s), separated by comma. Each license should be specified by using the correct identifier in the [https://spdx.org/licenses/](SPDX License List). Example: CC-BY-SA-4.0. Unsure? [Choose a Creative Commons license here](https://creativecommons.org/choose/).
- `@details`: some additional information about the music
- `@url`: web page(s) related to the music (git repository, Soundcloud link, etc.)
- `@genre`: music genre(s) (pop, jazz, etc.)
- `@album`: music album name
- `@tag`: custom tag

Note to tool authors: _Never_ trust that a song has filled those fields with syntactically correct values; make sure your software is robust enough it doesn't break if it encounters bad values

## Multiple values

Some of them accepts several values, using the comma or new line separator, or duplicating the tag:

```js
/*
@by John Doe
    Jane Doe
@genre pop, jazz
@url https://example.com
@url https://example.org
*/
```

You can also add optional prefixes and use tags where you want:

```js
/*
song @by John Doe
samples @by Jane Doe
*/
...
note("a3 c#4 e4 a4") // @by Sandy Sue
```

## Multiline

If a tag doesn't accept a list, it can take multi-line values:

```js
/*
@details I wrote this song in February 19th, 2023.
         It was around midnight and I was lying on
         the sofa in the living room.
*/
```

# Searching meta-data in the online repl

Meta-data can be used in the search field of the patterns tab in the online repl.

For example to search for all patterns by a specific author use the search term

```
by: Ada L
```

or search for patterns with a specific genre like

```
genre: unicorns
```

Hint: If no meta-data property is provided in the search all patterns with a `@title`, `@by` or `@tag` matching the search term will be shown.
